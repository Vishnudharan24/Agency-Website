#Agency Website


This is an web application that i developed in my first semester of undergrad as i was learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. And how an web app works and how to make one.

This is an web app for agencies to display their products and services and about them their portfolio and many other things.

This one has an database connectivity using php and it also has an product page where you can buy services. There might be a lot of bugs in the code as it was my first one.

You can just clone this repository and open the index.html and find some good stuff.

It contains p1.py python script that i just used to convert all the .php files to .html files so don't think that its an malware.
